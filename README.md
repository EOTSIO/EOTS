# EOT - The Most Powerful Infrastructure for Decentralized Applications


Welcome to the EOT source code repository!  EOT software enables developers to create and deploy high-performance, horizontally scalable, blockchain infrastructure upon which decentralized applications can be built.

We are prepared to issue a total of 270 million coins.

This code is currently beta-quality and under rapid development. That said, there is plenty early experimenters can do. This includes running a private multi-node test network and developing applications (smart contracts).

There is no public testnet running currently.

## Supported Operating Systems
EOT currently supports the following operating systems:  
1. Amazon 2017.09 and higher
2. Centos 7
3. Fedora 25 and higher (Fedora 27 recommended)
4. Mint 18
5. Ubuntu 16.04 (Ubuntu 16.10 recommended)
6. MacOS Darwin 10.12 and higher (MacOS 10.13.x recommended)

## Getting Started
Instructions detailing the process of getting the software, building it, running a simple test network that produces blocks, account creation and uploading a sample contract to the blockchain can be found for this GitHub repository.
